    "title": "About Us — Luminary Counseling",
    "content": "Title: About Us — Luminary Counseling Content: Our goal is to empower women and teen girls to reduce feelings of overwhelm, enhance emotional clarity, and improve relationships. Creating space by getting rid of things that no longer serve you invites possibility, opportunity, and more space for love. Located in Central Illinois, we provide counseling and mental health support for women and adolescent girls age 12. Luminary is a counseling agency comprised of five female clinicians utilizing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and modern approaches to therapy and mental wellness in Springfield, Illinois. Founded in 2020 by Lauren Henton and Katie Romang, the goal is to empower women to reduce feelings of overwhelm and to enhance personal and emotional clarity through mental health care. Identifying as a woman comes with many joys, and there is much to celebrate about the female experience. However, the unique roles that women play throughout their lives also come with unique difficulties. Women often put the needs of others ahead of their own and ignore their own challenges until the burden becomes too heavy. This can leave women feeling unsupported, isolated, and drained. We want to remind women how important it is to put yourself first while recognizing how hard that can be. For our younger clients, we aim to establish a solid foundation of positive self image and to infuse coping strategies that encourage befriending yourself early on, rather than normalizing an inner critic. At Luminary, our sessions provide a safe, nurturing, non-judgmental environment for you to explore your thoughts, feelings, relationships, and experiences. Here, you can talk openly about your vulnerabilities. Consider this a safe space to turn down the volume of your inner critic, boost your self-esteem, and gain a deeper sense of emotional freedom. You are not alone, and help is available. Our intake process is relaxed and conversational. We will listen carefully, learn about your story, and develop an understanding of what is challenging or motivating you in the present. From there, we can help you develop increased insight about the patterns of your behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and their purpose. This can help you to identify and examine more effective and satisfying ways to fulfill your lifes blueprint. We offer a safe and supportive space where you can share your challenges and get the support you deserve. Our therapists specialize in areas of anxiety and stress relief, depression, self-esteembody image issues, and overall wellness and life-balance in addition to other specialty areas. We believe that our clinicians can develop a unique and genuine connection with you which will aid in the healing process. Our clinicians are trained in methods of Mindfulness, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Motivational Interviewing.",
